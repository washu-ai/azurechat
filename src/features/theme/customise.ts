Please note that, like the public instance of ChatGPT, this tool should not currently be used with data protected under HIPAA or FERPA, or any other sensitive information.
<br/><br/>
The goal of creating this Beta instance of ChatGPT for the WashU community is to establish a secure sandbox environment for approved research and operational purposes. We are testing and working towards a security review by December 2023 to provide a fully secure and compliant tool.
<br/><br/>
Please be aware that this Beta version has no content filters, such as for explicit words, and refrain from participating in any harmful or offensive activities. Review the university's <a href="https://wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/" target="_blank">compliance policies</a> for more information. All user interactions are logged and linked to the userâ€™s WUSTL key account.`;
